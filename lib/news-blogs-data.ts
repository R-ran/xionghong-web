      <p>Hollow anchor bar systems are widely used in tunnel construction, yet contractors still encounter recurring installation issues.</p>

      <h2>Frequent Failure Modes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Poor grout mixing that reduces pull-out capacity</li>
        <li>Incorrect drilling parameters that cause anchor bending</li>
        <li>Insufficient corrosion protection in high-moisture strata</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Mitigate</h2>
      <p>Employ on-site grout quality tests, adhere to recommended drilling torque, and specify hot-dip galvanized accessories for aggressive environments.</p>

      <p>Our engineering specialists can assist with inspection checklists and training to ensure consistent results.</p>
